 Golang tracing utility.

## About

 This package allows you to instrument a program with trace probes which
 emit arbitrary data. Zero or more plugins can act on the events emitted,
 otherwise they are simply discarded.

 The primary use-case for this package is to provide instrumentation for
 top-like utilities.
